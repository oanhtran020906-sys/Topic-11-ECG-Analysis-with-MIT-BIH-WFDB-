# Topic 11 – ECG Analysis with MIT-BIH (WFDB)

**Level:** Hard  
**Goal:** Work with ECG waveforms (e.g., MIT-BIH Arrhythmia).

## Library & Data

- **WFDB Python:** https://wfdb.io/software/python.html
- **MIT-BIH Database:** Available via WFDB

## Installation

```bash
pip install wfdb
```

## Data Loading

```python
import wfdb
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

record = wfdb.rdrecord("100", pn_dir="mitdb")
signal = record.p_signal[:, 0]  # first channel
fs = record.fs

times = pd.to_timedelta(np.arange(len(signal)) / fs, unit="s")
ecg_series = pd.Series(signal, index=times)
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Library Setup and Data Access
- Install WFDB library
- Access MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database
- Explore available records
- Select record(s) for analysis
- Understand WFDB data structure

### 2. Data Exploration
- Load ECG signals from selected records
- Inspect sampling rate (typically 360 Hz for MIT-BIH)
- Plot raw ECG waveforms
- Identify QRS complexes and other features
- Examine signal quality

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- **Filtering:**
  - Apply band-pass filter (e.g., 0.5-40 Hz)
  - Remove baseline wander
  - Remove power line interference (50/60 Hz)
- **Artifact Removal:**
  - Identify and handle artifacts
  - Use appropriate filtering techniques
- **Normalization:**
  - Normalize amplitude if needed

### 4. Feature Extraction
- **QRS Detection:**
  - Detect R-peaks (heartbeats)
  - Calculate heart rate (HR) time series
  - Extract RR intervals
- **Waveform Features:**
  - Extract P, Q, R, S, T wave features
  - Calculate morphological features
- **Create Time Series:**
  - Heart rate over time
  - RR interval series
  - Other derived features

### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Plot ECG waveforms
- Visualize heart rate over time
- Analyze RR interval distributions
- Identify arrhythmias or abnormal patterns
- Perform time series decomposition of HR

### 6. Stationarity Analysis
- Test extracted features (e.g., HR) for stationarity
- Apply transformations if needed
- Consider segmenting by rhythm type

### 7. Model Building
- **Heart Rate Time Series:**
  - Apply ARIMA/SARIMA to HR series
  - Model RR intervals
- **Event Detection (advanced):**
  - Detect arrhythmias
  - Model event occurrences
- **Morphological Analysis (advanced):**
  - Analyze waveform changes over time

### 8. Model Evaluation
- Split data temporally
- Generate forecasts (e.g., future HR)
- Calculate accuracy metrics
- Visualize results
- Compare with clinical expectations

### 9. Clinical Interpretation
- Interpret results in cardiology context
- Identify normal vs abnormal patterns
- Discuss implications for monitoring
- Compare with ECG literature

## Expected Deliverables

1. **EDA Report:**
   - ECG waveform plots
   - Heart rate analysis
   - RR interval analysis
   - Pattern identification

2. **Model Results:**
   - Selected models for HR/features
   - Forecast accuracy
   - Visualization of results
   - Clinical interpretation

3. **Code:**
   - Complete Python notebook
   - WFDB data loading functions
   - QRS detection and feature extraction
   - Visualization utilities

## Tips

- ECG data requires specialized preprocessing and analysis
- QRS detection is crucial for extracting meaningful features
- Heart rate time series is more suitable for standard time series methods than raw ECG
- Use appropriate filtering (band-pass, notch) for clean signals
- Understand ECG morphology (P, Q, R, S, T waves) for proper analysis
- Consider different rhythm types (normal sinus, arrhythmias) in analysis
- RR intervals can be modeled as time series
- Document all preprocessing steps clearly
- Use WFDB's built-in functions for reading and processing
- Consult cardiology literature for appropriate analysis methods
- Consider event-based analysis (arrhythmia detection) in addition to continuous forecasting
- High-frequency raw ECG may need downsampling or feature extraction for standard methods
